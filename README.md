# Chess Trainer Blazor Sample

This project presents users with chess tactics puzzles.

## Project purpose

This project is primarily designed as a learning exercise for Blazor. It is branched from a [somewhat larger project](https://github.com/mjrousos/chesstrainer) that also exercised Azure Functions and Azure Logic Apps to queue chess games to have puzzles automatically idenitified.

This project demonstrates how server-side Blazor can be used to allow users to interact with a non-trivial UI (the chess board) by combining Blazor components and JavaScript.

## Technology used

* ASP.NET Core 3.1
* Server-side Blazor
* Entity Framework Core 3.1
* Material Design Components for Web
* Azure AD B2C
